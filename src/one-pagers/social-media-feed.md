###### Take control over your own social media feeds

With the degradation of the user experience of every social media site's feed I wanted to have more direct control over my data feed.

Being able to categorize discrete actions and types of posts of the people/feeds should allow for a personalized feed. For example, you may follow a user for their art/media posts and only want those posts to show up in your feed. You can also use actions like retweets or likes as recommendations for your own "For You" feed.

#### Defintion of Done

Create a feed from twitter or mastodon that allows for custom filters by post type/feature

#### Definition of Awesome

- Combine feeds of multiple social media sites
- Set global and user specific rules for inclusion in feeds
