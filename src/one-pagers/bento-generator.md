###### Generate balanced bento boxes with variable ingedients

Bentos are notoriously time consuming to make, but I like the idea of having a variety of things for a packed lunch. I'm not a fan of having the same thing for every lunch all week, so being able to mix things up while limiting the amount of preparation needed to achieve this would be ideal.

#### Definition of Done

Generate a list of recipes and ingredients for a given specification of a bento

#### Definition of Awesome

- Visualization of the bento with proportions
- Specification including macros
- Generate a list of bentos for the week with variety each day
- Optimize for amount of time to prepare
